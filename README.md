# Orbital-Graph-Convolutional-Neural-Network
OGCNN
This is the repository for our work on property prediction for crystals. In this work we have used ideas from the Orbital Field matrix and Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network to predict material properties with a higher accuracy.
The two important papers referenced for this work are:
1. Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for an Accurate and Interpretable Prediction of Material Properties (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.145301)
2. Machine learning reveals orbital interaction in crystalline materials (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5678453/)

We used the ideas from these papers and did some of our modifications to develop the OGCNN which gives a higher performance than the seminal work of CGCNN
